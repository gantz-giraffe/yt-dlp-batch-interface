To use this, put the yt-dlp-interface.bat file in a directory that has (ideally the latest) yt-dlp binary which can be found here: 
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases

Click on yt-dlp-interface.bat, copy paste the url of the video you want, hit enter, then you should have your video downloaded to the same directory as this script.

If it stops working, try checking if there's a newer release of yt-dlp, and if there is, swap out the old binary for the newest one.
